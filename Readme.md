  ## Chalenges:

   my main challenge in this application was connecting to mysql database and also,
   joining my various tables using the left join,join, including my index.js file.
   Not forgetting my promps, thankGod the last assignment we did already tought me how to prompt but
   this one was a liitle different as my async and await funtions here were used multiple time.
   thanks to the internet which teaches alot of things about that too

   ## Utilities:

     Here in this application, i mainly used languages and runed environments like
   - Javascript
   - Jquery
   - Node
   - sql server

   ## Approach:

   my approach to this app was,
   - creating my database first
   - creating my tables 
   - creating my seed.sql
   - moving my information from my database to my employee.sql
   - creating my index.js to connect to my data base which was the hardest part of my app, i needed to use inquirer here ,to
   use my async await functions properly
